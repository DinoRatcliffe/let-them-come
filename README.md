Simple script that changes N number of occurrences of "lose" to "loose"

## Usage
`./ill-be-waiting [filename] [number of occurrences to change]` e.g. `./ill-be-waiting game-design.tex 2`

Oh and this doesn't overwrite your original file so remember to pipe it to a new file 

`./ill-be-waiting game-design.tex 2 > final.tex`
